    "### Dice Rolls and Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the [previous notebook on probability modeling in Python](https://github.com/practicallypredictable/posts/blob/master/notebooks/probability-part1-poker_hands.ipynb). In this notebook, we will discuss the concept of [_probability distribution_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) and how to represent it in Python. Our previous discussion on [classical probabilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_definition_of_probability) only dealt with situations where all outcomes are equally likely. That's not a very realistic framework for analyzing sports or other real-world scenarios. In this notebook, we'll look at how even simple dice rolls result in unequal probabilities, and why we need distributions to represent the outcomes. Looking forward to future posts, we will analyze some interesting board games and start estimating win probabilities in basketball and baseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous notebook, the Python framework developed here is inspired by and borrows from two excellent sources: [Peter Norvig's](http://norvig.com/) [Concrete Introduction to Probability (using Python)](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Probability.ipynb) and [Allen Downey's](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/) [blog post on using the Python `Counter` class to represent probability mass functions](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2014/05/implementing-pmfs-in-python.html). I highly recommend these two sources to you, and hope that you find the approach I've taken here combines some of the best aspects of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independent Dice Rolls\n",
    "\n",
    "A fair six-sided die has equally likely outcomes. Each side can land face-up with probability $\\frac 1 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume that we have two fair six-sided dice, which are labelled so we can tell them apart. Call them $D_1$ and $D_2$. Our experiment is to roll both dice at the same time and observe which faces land up. If we assume that the outcome on $D_1$ has no impact on the outcome on $D_2$ (and vice versa), then the outcomes are [_independent_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)). Even though it may seem physically obvious that two fair dice should have indepdent outcomes, we should always remember that independence is an assumption that must be carefully thought through. Many errors in probability and statistics occur from wrongly assuming independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming independence of $D_1$ and $D_2$, there are $6^2 = 36$ possible combined outcomes from rolling both dice at the same time. We can have 1 through 6 for $D_1$, and 1 through 6 for $D_2$, and the 36 possible outcomes are the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of the $D_1$ and $D_2$ outcomes. Some possible example outcomes are (1, 5), (2, 4) and (4, 2). The ordered pairs show the outcome of $D_1$ first, followed by the outcome of $D_2$. Notice that (2, 4) and (4, 2) are different outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, this isn't very different from the poker hands analysis we did in the previous notebook. There are 36 possible outcomes, and each are equally likely with probability $\\frac 1 {36}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum of Dice Rolls\n",
    "\n",
    "In most games, however, we usually don't keep track of specific dice ($D_1$ vs. $D_2$). We look at outcomes such as the sum of the two dice, and whether we've rolled doubles (both dice showing the same number). In the board game [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game), we move our token based on the sum of the dice rolls, and if we've rolled doubles, we can roll again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the example outcomes above, it's obvious that the outcomes cannot be equally likely if we care about the sum of the dice rolls. The outcomes (1, 5), (2, 4) and (4, 2) all have sum 6. There are actually 5 outcomes that have sum 6. We need to include (5, 1) and (3, 3) as well. Notice also that there are 11 possible outcomes for the sum of two dice, ranging from 2 to 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we roll three dice, there are $6^3 = 216$ possible outcomes if we keep track of the specific dice, but only 16 outcomes (from 3 to 18) for the sum. Again, the sum of the rolls are not equally likely outcomes. Can you guess which outcomes are most likely for the sum of two and three dice rolls?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sum of dice, we can still use the machinery of classical probability to a limited extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to know the probability of having the sum of two dice be 6, we can work with the 36 underlying outcomes of the form $(D_1, D_2)$ and define the event of interest $A$ to be the set of outcomes such $D_1 + D_2 = 36$. Then $P(A) = \\frac 5 {36}$ from the usual rules of classical probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's much better to just keep track of the possible outcomes and their (not necessarily equal) probabilities. This will be very useful for handing more complicated situations than dice rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possible ways to represent a mathematical probability distribution. Here, we are going to focus on the [_probability mass function_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) (or PMF) for representing distributions on discrete finite sample spaces. A PMF is basically just a mapping between an outcome and its probability, with the additional rule that the sum of the probabilities over all possible outcomes must equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Quick Note about Interpretations of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about probability distributions, we are moving away from classical probability and toward more general and abstract concepts. One advantage of classical probability is that it fits with our physical intuition about games of chance and other familiar situations. However, classical probability isn't immune to criticism. The English mathematician [John Venn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Venn) (the inventor of the famous [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram)) and others in the nineteenth century felt that probability theory was on shaky ground. In the 1930s, the great Russian mathematican [Andrei Kolmogorov](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/#KolProCal) put probability on firm mathematical footing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the mathematics of probability is well-established, there is still significant debate even today about [what, if anything, probability means in the real world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are going to side-step debates over [Frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) versus [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) interpretations of probability, at least for the time being.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Probability Distributions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the built-in [`Counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) class is a very good way to represent the mapping of a probability distribution. We will also continue to represent the numerical value of probability using Python's built-in [`Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html) class, since probabilities are ratios and `Fraction` can represent them exactly."
