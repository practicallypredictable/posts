    "In the [first notebook in this series on NBA home court advantage](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/practicallypredictable/posts/blob/master/notebooks/nba_home_court-part1.ipynb), we saw that home court win percentages varied over the past 21 seasons, but have averaged around 60%.\n",

    "Within a given NBA season, teams vary enormously in quality. From the historical data, we know that an average team (with a 50% win percentage) has roughly a 10% improvement in win probability from playing at home. But what about low-quality teams or elite teams? What does home court advantage look like for teams that aren't average?\n",

    "### Grouping by Season and Team\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's group the matchup information by season and team so we can look for patterns. To do this, we'll use the `pandas` [`groupby`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) methods. These methods are very powerful but can be tricky to use correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping will allow us to calculate aggregate statistics for a particular team in a particular season. Teams change over time, as rosters, coaches and management evolve. Of course, there's also variation in team lineups intra-season, due to trades and injuries. We will eventually get to the player level of detail, but for now we will focus on the regular season as a reasonable time unit for analysizing a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also split the home and away games in this grouping. We can subtract the away game statistics from the home game statistics, controlling for season and team. This will allow us to develop a purer estimate of the impact of home court.\n",
