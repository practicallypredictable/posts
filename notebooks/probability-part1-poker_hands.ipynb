    "### Getting Started with Probability Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces a framework to represent the mathematical concept of [_probability_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) in Python. We'll develop tools over a series of posts that we can use to analyze games of chance and some popular board games. We will also show how to apply these ideas to uncertainty in sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by analyzing familiar examples such as coin flips, dice rolls, and a shuffled deck of playing cards. These examples are commonly used in teaching probability, because most people have good physical intuition for these random processes. We will analyze these processes (and the games which use them) using the rules of [classical probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_definition_of_probability). As the great French astronomer and mathematician [Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace) [wrote in 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9orie_analytique_des_probabilit%C3%A9s):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to it, to the number of all cases possible when nothing leads us to expect that any one of these cases should occur more than any other, which renders them, for us, equally possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that the coins, dice and cards are _fair_, we can assume all possible outcomes are equally likely. That's because of the (assumed) physical symmetry of of the objects. A fair coin has a $\\frac 1 2$ probability of landing heads or tails, and a six-sided die has a $\\frac 1 6$ probability of landing with any one face showing up. Similarly, a shuffled [French deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_playing_cards) without jokers has a $\\frac 1 {52}$ probability to draw any particular card from the top of the deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the coin and die example, we're assuming away any \"impossible\" outcomes such as the coin balancing exactly on its edge, or the die balancing on a corner with no side facing up. Our physical intuition says these things are so unlikely that we are very safe ignoring them. If people want to play Monopoly or flip coins in outer space, they will need to rethink things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, [serious scientific testing in 2007](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf) revealed that [coins actually seem to come up with the same side showing as before the flip around 51% of the time](https://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/10001.6-8.shtml). We will put aside the question of whether a possible 51-49 bias (versus the assumed 50-50) matters in the real world, at least for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more we could discuss about the philosophical aspects of probability, and the limitations of the classical approach, but let's move on to some practical aspects of probability modeling. Over the course of these posts, you'll see that we can answer some interesting and useful questions about games of chance and popular board games. We'll also be able to extend this probability framework to better understand uncertainty in sports. We will incorporate some of the more complex probability concepts, and some of the tricks and pitfalls, down the road as we need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python framework developed in this notebook is inspired by and borrows from two excellent sources: [Peter Norvig's](http://norvig.com/) [Concrete Introduction to Probability (using Python)](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Probability.ipynb) and [Allen Downey's](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/) [blog post on using the Python `Counter` class to represent probability mass functions](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2014/05/implementing-pmfs-in-python.html). I highly recommend these two sources to you, and hope that you find the approach I've taken here combines some of the best aspects of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Essentials of Classical Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of the basic things to keep in mind about classical probability modeling:\n",
    "* There are a _finite_ number of _discrete_ possible [outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability%29).\n",
    "* Because they are finite and discrete, the outcomes can be written down in a list called the [sample space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space) and counted (although this may be cumbersome to do in practice, since the number of possible outcomes may be very large, as we'll soon see). The sample space must have at least two possible outcomes for there to be any uncertainty.\n",
    "* We are going to conduct an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory%29) (e.g., flipping a coin), which has an uncertain outcome that we are going to observe.\n",
    "* The outcomes are _mutually exclusive and exhaustive_, meaning one and only one of the outcomes will occur in the experiment, and an event outside the sample space cannot occur. The coin either lands heads or tails, but not both. It also doesn't float away (as in outer space) or land on its edge, which would count as neither.\n",
    "* The random process of the experiment (e.g., the coin and how it is flipped) is _fair_, so that each of the possible outcomes is equally likely.\n",
    "* An [event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory%29) is a set of one or more outcomes that we want to study (e.g., the coin lands heads, or a six-sided die roll is higher than 3).\n",
    "* The classical _probability_ of an event is just the fraction with numerator [number of outcomes from the sample space in the event] and denominator [number of outcomes in the sample space].\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard math symbol for the probability of some event $A$ is $P(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this machinery just makes precise what we already intuitively know:\n",
    "* $P$(fair coin lands heads) = $\\frac 1 2$. Here, the experiment is a coin flip, and the event is a particular outcome {H}.\n",
    "* $P$(six-sided die roll of 4 or 5) = $\\frac 2 6$ = $\\frac 1 3$. Here, the experiment is a die roll, and the event is a set of two outcomes {4, 5}.\n",
    "* $P$(draw a heart from a freshly-shuffled standard French deck) = $\\frac {13} {52}$ = $\\frac 1 4$. Here, the experiment is a draw from a deck, and the event is a set of thirteen possible outcomes {2-10, J, Q, K, A, all of hearts}.\n",
    "* $P$(coin flip lands either heads or tails) = 1.\n",
    "* $P$(six-sided die roll shows 7) = 0.\n",
    "* $P$(six-sided die roll either shows an even number or an odd number) = $P$({2, 4, 6}) + $P$({1, 3, 5}) = $\\frac 1 2$ + $\\frac 1 2 $ = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of the mathematical machinery is that it lets us think clearly and consistently about more complicated situations with much larger numbers of potential outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Although fair coins, dice and playing cards are very simple random processes, you will see how the number of possible outcomes can quickly become very large, even for some relatively simple games.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the trickiest aspects of probability modeling is accurately keeping track of the possible outcomes, and counting which ones are in the event you're interested in studying. Keeping track of the outcomes becomes tedious and error-prone: exactly the right job for a computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at probability and statistics textbooks, you'll see a lot of complicated formulas, which were developed before the era of electronic calculation. Very smart people used advanced mathematics to develop these formulas, along with approximations and numerical tables to allow people working with pencil and paper to grind through problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that letting the computer keep track of the outcomes allows you to easily analyze situations which theoretically have millions of possible outcomes, such as [five card draw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-card_draw), which has [almost 2.6 million possible hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability#Frequency_of_5-card_poker_hands). Other variants of poker have many more possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that the advanced math is now useless because of computers; far from it. Combining math with computers allows for the solution of complex probability and machine learning problems that would make simplistic computer programs choke or crash. It's just that counting huge numbers is hard for people, and the simpler computer methods can give better intuition and help sanity-check the results. Our goal is to learn how to practically apply both the math and computer modeling to get useful answers quickly and intuitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Probabilities in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Since classical probability is mostly about counting, it makes sense that Python's standard library [`Counter` class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) should play a role. Also, since probabilities are fractions, it makes sense to represent them using Python's standard library [`Fraction` class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html)."

    "Everything checks out. We'll stop here for now, but there's a lot more to say about probability in upcoming posts. This post only looked at random processes with equal probabilities for each outcome in the sample space. We'll see in future posts how easy it is to use Python's `Counter` class to handle more general situations. We'll also build much more useful Python tools to take advantage of that flexibiilty. But even with the few dozen lines of code in this post, we were able to quickly build some tools to help us analyze poker hands.\n",

    "### Some Closing Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The poker analysis illustrates the pros and cons of simple but brute force computing power, compared to detailed mathematical analysis. If you look at the [Wikipedia page for the frequency of five-card poker hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability#Frequency_of_5-card_poker_hands) again, you'll see in the far-right column detailed formulas for the frequency of each hand. Unless you've studied some [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), these formulas probably won't make much sense. The point is that is possible to solve these poker probabilities \"by hand\", if you reason carefully about the number of ways a given hand can occur. Combinatorics is the advanced mathematical analysis of counting, and is used in many fields, including computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical analysis is powerful and elegant, but can be tricky. The advantage of the straightforward approach taken here is that it's hard to make a mistake. Other people can also quickly understand your method just by reading the code. Ideally, the best approach would combine the benefits of both mathematical analysis and the smart application of computing power. We could have made our code run faster, for instance, by recognizing that it does a lot of duplicate work. The probability calculation essentially checks every possible hand, for every possible hand type.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, to count flushes, we don't care what suit the hand is in, as long as all cards are in the same suit. To speed things up, we could have worked with a deck of only one suit, and counted up all the possible flushes in that one-suit deck. Then, we would just multiply by 4 to get the number of flushes in the true deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we wrote works fine for the five-card analysis here, especially since this an analysis we only need to run once. If we needed to recompute probabilities frequently (to update a win probability during a sports event, for instance), we would care a lot more about speed. For problems with much larger sample spaces, we would almost certainly need to be smarter, to avoid having our code run out of computer memory or run too slowly."
