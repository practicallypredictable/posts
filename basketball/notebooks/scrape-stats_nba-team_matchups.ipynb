    "## Web Scraping NBA Team Matchups and Box Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use machine learning and statistics to predict NBA matchups. To do this, we are going to need data on NBA games, and lots of it. So let's get all the team matchups and box scores from [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com/), and make them ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post has two purposes. The first is to show you how to do the actual web scraping. The second purpose is to show you how to examine data before you us it. Data are almost always a bit messy and need to be handled with care. It's important to take some time to look at data and to make sure it's clean before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post has a lot of code. If you don't want to spend time going through it, you can just run the code if you want. The code in this post will scrape and store the data for you. You won't need to run this code again after you get the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the most useful information in this post is learning how to assess the data quality, and make smart decisions about how to address potential problems. If you decide to just skim the code and focus on the decisions, hopefully this example will still be useful for you. You may also find it interesting to see how real-world NBA facts (such as expansion teams, team moves and name changes) actually impacts the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to scrape [Team Box Scores for completed NBA seasons from stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/teams/boxscores-traditional/?Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season). We are going to start with tradtional box scores, which give us plenty of statistics to consider, as well as all the matchup information we need. If you explore the site, you'll see there are also other more advanced data available. We'll consider these other data in future posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced data are only available going back to the 1996-97 season, so we'll limit our traditional box scores to the same time period. The site actually has traditional box scores going back to the 1946-47 season. Such old data are interesting, but aren't useful for predicting current matchups. We have to consider how much the game has changed over the years.  Although [there have been a number of NBA rule changes since 1996](http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html) and game style has evolved, I think data over this time period are still useful today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from 1996-97 to 2016-17 comprise 21 complete seasons, including pre-season data from recent years. This is plenty of data for our purposes. Notice that we're not going to download data from the current 2017-18 season yet. We are going to use the historical data for building prediction models, since we know how the seasons turned out. After we build the model, we can apply it to the current season and see how it does over the remainder of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Write a Web Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned, there's a lot of code in this post. You may wonder why it's worth it to build a web scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in many cases it's the easiest way to get the data you need. Even if it takes a few hours to build a scraper, it's a lot faster than manually downloading it. Consider the excellent site, [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). Basketball Reference offers you the ability to download games into a CSV file. [Here is a link to the 2016-17 season games](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2017_games.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this site shows games grouped by month. You can download the games by looking at the \"Share & More\" drop-down menu next to the month schedule header. Each month requires a separate download. So, if you want to download all the games for the 21 complete seasons since 1996-97, you'd need to manually download around 180 CSV files (there are 9 months in the typical NBA season). Then, to create a master spreadsheet of matchup results, you'd need to open them up in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets and put all the data together in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you click on one of the box score links (for example, [the October 25, 2016 matchup between the Knicks and the Cavaliers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201610250CLE.html)), you'll see very detailed box score information, but no easy way to extract and download all the box scores at once. Scraping the original data is much faster and more practical. As you'll see, it's not actually that hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, writing a scraper is essential if you want to update the data relatively frequently. If you create a matchup prediction model, you'll want to run it after every game, to update the probabilities for future matchups. Imagine if you had to type information into a spreadsheet or download a few new spreadsheets every night during the NBA season?\n",
    "\n",
    "The web scraper we'll develop here will also be able to scrape current season games. So once you have it working, you can run each day during the NBA season to get the lastest matchup results and team box scores automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraping a JavaScript-Rendered Web Site\n",
    "\n",
    "[stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com/) is a JavaScript-rendered site. As [discussed in our previous post on web-scraping](http://practicallypredictable.com/2017/11/21/introduction-to-web-scraping/#html-versus-javascript-rendered-pages), these sites work differently from HTML-rendered sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can still use the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) package to communicate with the web site, but we can't use [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) like we did previously. BeautifulSoup is great for scraping HTML-rendered sites, but it doesn't work with JavaScript-rendered sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping the box scores isn't actually very hard, but it has one very tricky aspect. The URL to send the GET request isn't the same URL that you see in your browser. Remember that the whole point of JavaScript-rendered pages is the web site returns JavaScript code to your browser, which then runs the JavaScript to get the data to render in the browser window. The URL you want to scrape is really that second URL, which returns the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the specific links for the box scores. The URL for the link to the page we can view is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://stats.nba.com/teams/boxscores-traditional/?Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season`\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear from the URL that this page has traditional box scores for the 2016-17 regular season. It's pretty clear that we can access different seasons by changing the _parameters_ at the end of the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here's the trick. The URL which returns the actual data is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://stats.nba.com/stats/teamgamelogs?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00`\n",
    "`&Location=&MeasureType=Base&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PORound=0&PaceAdjust=N&PerMode=Totals&Period=0`\n",
    "`&PlusMinus=N&Rank=N&Season=2016-17&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Regular+Season`\n",
    "`&ShotClockRange=&VsConference=&VsDivision=`\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all actually one line, which I've broken up for clarity. You can [open up the a browser tab with the raw data by clicking this link](https://stats.nba.com/stats/teamgamelogs?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&MeasureType=Base&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PORound=0&PaceAdjust=N&PerMode=Totals&Period=0&PlusMinus=N&Rank=N&Season=2016-17&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Regular+Season&ShotClockRange=&VsConference=&VsDivision=). Notice that this URL has a lot of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how did I figure out that this is the correct URL?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the Browser Developer Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in [the prior post on web scraping](http://practicallypredictable.com/2017/11/21/introduction-to-web-scraping/#use-your-browser8217s-developer-tools), your browser's developer tools make it easier to see what is going on. In that post, we used the **Elements** section of the developer tools to look at the different HTML tags. To scrape this JavaScript-rendered page, we will instead use the **Network** section. [Here are instructions for how to use these tools in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference). [Here are similar instructions for Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor). I think these browsers are the easiest to use to understand JavaScript-rendered sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the **Network** section, check out the **XHR** tab. _XHR_ is short for [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), but the details don't matter. The point is that if you load (or reload) the page (with the \"normal\" URL above), you will see a few lines show up under the **XHR** tab, one of which starts with `teamgamelogs`. That's the item we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you select that `teamgamelogs` item, in either Chrome or Firefox, you can explore what's in that object. I'll move on the scraping now, but hopefully this brief introduction will serve to explain how you could figure this out for yourself on a different web page. As we go through the steps below, see if you can follow along and find the corresponding information in your browser's developer tools on that **XHR** tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you explore other pages on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/) with the developer tools open to the **XHR** tab, you'll be able to apply these techniques to figure out how to scrape those other pages, too.\n",
    "\n",

    "Whoa, right away we see that we have some non-NBA teams represented, from pre-season exhibition-type games. We will exclude those in a moment, since we only want to have NBA matchups in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the easy part. The harder part is that team names and abbreviations have changed over time. Let's see what's going on in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there are some simple cases that aren't too difficult to understand. The Clippers changed their name in 2015 from the Los Angeles Clippers to the LA Clippers. The abbreviation and 'team_id' didn't change, however. No big deal. There's a similar situation with Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a team move like the Thunder, you have to keep track of the abbreviation change. Although the 'team_id' stays the same, the abbrevation changes from 'SEA' to 'OKC' reflecting the team move from Seattle to Oklahoma City in 2008. There's a similar situation with the Grizzlies and the Nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most complicated situation is with Charlotte and New Orleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hornets and Pelicans\n",
    "\n",
    "As [descibed in detail here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets), the Charlotte Hornets moved to New Orleans in 2002. The Charlotte Bobcats joined the NBA as an expansion team in 2004. Prior to the 2014-15 season, the Charlotte Bobcats and the New Orleans Hornets agreed to a deal whereby New Orleans would become the Pelicans and the Hornets name and history would revert to Charlotte. This explains why the abbreviation 'CHA' is used for both the Charlotte Bobcats and the Charlotte Hornets, in addition to the 'CHH' abbreviation for the other Charlotte Hornets (the team that moved in 2002 and ultimately became the Pelicans).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another complication is that [because of Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_the_New_Orleans_Hornets), the New Orleans Hornets had to relocate for much of the 2005-6 and 2006-7 seasons to Oklahoma City. That's why there is an abbreviation 'NOK' to represent the games that were played under the label New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sort this out and make sure we understand this in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let build a table with the current 30 NBA teams, so we can keep track of historical abbreviations and how they map to current teams. Remember that the 'team_id' is meant to be a unique identifier for each team, even if the abbreviation or team name changes."
